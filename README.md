## Public Resume of Alex Kaszynski

This is the public resume of Alexander Anthony Kaszynski.  Feel free
to contact me at my personal email address at <akascap@gmail.com> for
serious inquires.

See my [resume](https://akaszynski.github.io/resume/) for more details
regarding my employment, education, and skills.


### Employment
I am currently fully employed as a lead software developer at
[ANSYS](https://www.ansys.com/) as of June 2019.  I also have some
additional persistent contract work with the Air Force research labs
that includes maintenance of closed-source software I wrote between
2011 and 2019.  The software, FEMORPH, modifies finite element models
to match as-manufactured geometry to create highly accurate geometric
models.  The software has been licensed by Pratt & Whitney and is used
for research and development by the Air Force Research Lab.  See:

- [FEMORPH Section 801 Software License](https://federallabs.org/successes/awards/awards-gallery/2019/femorph-section-801-software-license-first-in-department-of)


### Open Source Contribution
Most of my open source projects can be found on my GitHub landing page
at [akaszynski](https://github.com/akaszynski), but I've also
contributed or created several open source projects that have been
moved over to [pyvista](https://github.com/pyvista).  I'm a big
proponent of open-source and contribute to it when I can find time to.


### Research

My research has been focused on Finite Element Analysis and mesh
metamorphosis.  Feel free to browse my research at [research
papers](https://github.com/akaszynski/resume/tree/master/papers).
