See my [resume](https://akaszynski.github.io/resume/) for more details
regarding my employment, education, and skills.

Also, see my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-kaszynski-1319b1217/)
regarding my current and past employment, which is also summarized below.


### Employment
I am employed as a principal software engineer at
[Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/) since June 2019.  I also maintain software for
the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/), including the
maintenance of closed-source software I developed in 2011 and continue to
develop and maintain.  The software, FEMORPH, modifies finite element models to
match as-manufactured geometry to create highly accurate geometric models.  The
software has been licensed by [Pratt & Whitney](https://prattwhitney.com/) and
is used for research and development by the Air Force Research Laboratory.

### Open Source Contributions

Most of my open source projects can be found on my GitHub landing page
at [akaszynski](https://github.com/akaszynski), but I've also
contributed to or created several open source projects that have been
moved over to [PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista).  I'm a big
proponent of open-source and contribute to it whenever possible.


### Research

My research has been focused on Finite Element Analysis and mesh
metamorphosis.  Feel free to browse my research at [research
papers](https://github.com/akaszynski/resume/tree/master/papers).
